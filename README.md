==================

Microcontroller based project to generate various waveforms of different frequencies on CRO

## What is a function generator?
A function generator is usually a piece of electronic test equipment or software used to generate different types of electrical waveforms over a wide range of frequencies. Some of the most common waveforms produced by the function generator are the sine, square, triangular and saw-tooth shapes. These waveforms can be either repetitive or single-shot (which requires an internal or external trigger source)

##Requirement Specification: 
- Controller: 89v51rd2 (8051 variant)
- User Interface: Interactive form
- Misc:  DAC 0808 (all in one card kit of RVCE )
